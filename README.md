# VSN Website

Official static corporate website for **Vertex Systems Network (VSN)**.

## Architecture

- Plain HTML5 pages
- Shared CSS in `assets/styles.css`
- Shared vanilla JavaScript in `assets/app.js`
- No Node.js runtime
- No framework dependency
- No Vercel-specific package or configuration required
- Can run locally from any static HTTP server or compatible web host

## Local preview

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Main pages

- `index.html` — corporate homepage
- `services.html` — service overview
- `profile.html` — VSN Authority Profile

## Legal

Legal pages are in `legal/`. Internal consistency hardening is documented in `LEGAL-REVIEW.md`; final Pakistan-qualified legal/corporate review is still required before production launch.

## Deployment

This repository intentionally stays host-agnostic. Deploy the files to any static hosting environment or standard web server.

## Repository governance

Target main-branch protection and deterministic apply/verify commands are documented in `SECURITY-GOVERNANCE.md`. Repository protection must require pull requests while keeping required human approvals at zero for the AI-led workflow.

## Branding

The website references the official VSN logo supplied by the owner at `https://vertexsystemsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/vertex-logo.png` for the header, footer and favicon.
