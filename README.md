## AI-Native progress

- Overall launch readiness: **96%**
- Durable state: `.ai/state/CURRENT-STATE.yaml`
- Last checkpoint: `LAST-CHECKPOINT.md`

- Current external blocker: official logo is still loaded from the supplied WordPress URL because the PNG binary could not be fetched in the current execution environment.
